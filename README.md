# KeyKangaroo

KeyKangaroo is a password generator app built with PyQt5, inspired by Bitwarden. The goal is to educate users on what makes a safe password while making password creation easily accessible.

## Description

The user specifies a number representing the desired password length, and KeyKangaroo generates a password of that length. If the user chooses to save the password, they also have the option to copy it to the clipboard.

## Features

1. Generate Secure Passwords: Allow users to create strong, random passwords based on their desired length and criteria.
2. Copy to Clipboard: Provide a one-click option to copy the generated password for easy use.
3. Learn About Password Security: Include a button that educates users on what makes a password secure and offers tips for creating stronger passwords.

## Requirements
