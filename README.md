# KeyKangaroo

KeyKangaroo is a password manager app built with PyQt5, inspired by Bitwarden. The goal is to educate users on what makes a safe password while making password storage easily accessible.

## Description

The user specifies a number representing the desired password length, and KeyKangaroo generates a password of that length. If the user chooses to save the password, they will be prompted to specify the service for which it will be used.

## Features

1. Securing the vault by requiring a password to access it.
2. Generating secure passwords.
3. Storing passwords in a dictionary of Service:Password pairs.
4. Updating passwords.
5. Deleting passwords.

## Requirements
- A PC with an operating system like Windows, Linux, or macOS.
